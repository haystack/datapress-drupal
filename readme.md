Datapress for Drupal
====================

Datapress for Drupal helps you use the Exhibit visualization framework from within Drupal.

Datapress has three main features:

*  [Data Feeds](https://github.com/haystack/datapress-drupal/wiki/Data-Feeds) for your Drupal data
*  [Exhibit 3 Integration](https://github.com/haystack/datapress-drupal/wiki/Creating-an-Exhibit) integration with low overhead.
*  An easy HTML syntax for [repositioning Exhibit elements](https://github.com/haystack/datapress-drupal/wiki/Remapping-Interface-Elements) in your Drupal theme. 

Datapress for Drupal is different than [Datapress for
Wordpress](http://projects.csail.mit.edu/datapress) in that it takes a more
HTML-native approach, facilitating use of Exhibit's natural HTML syntax rather
than trying to wrap it with a Wizard.
